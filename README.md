The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In this project, I explored U.S. water pollution with data sourced from ProPublica's "Toxic Air Pollution Hot Spots" dataset. Through detailed visualizations including scatter plots, bar charts, and boxplots, the report examines the relationships between industrial facility proximity to water bodies and water release rates across states, counties (particularly in Florida), and EPA regions. The findings highlight notable trends and disparities, providing valuable insights for environmental policy and regulation considerations. My favorite visualization from this project is a scatterplot that shows the relationship between the mean distance to reach a body of water and the percentage of facilities reporting water releases by state. Florida is highlighted in red, and a linear regression line demonstrates the general trend. I show this plot below. Find the code and report in the `project_01/` folder.

## Project 02

In this project, I explored the relationship between various demographic and economic attributes as well as the walkability of regions in Florida using data from the National Walkability Index provided by the EPA. The dataset was filtered to focus on Florida and divided into CBSA regions, summarizing key statistics such as average walkability scores, working-age population percentage, district population, and low-wage worker percentage. The project includes an interactive scatter plot, a choropleth map, a coefficients plot from a multiple linear regression model, and a heatmap to visualize these relationships. The visualizations indicate that higher walkability is associated with a higher working-age population and a lower percentage of low-wage workers, providing insights for urban planning and policy-making. I decided to include the choropleth from this project below. It shows the average walkability of various CBSA regions in Florida. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

## Project 03

In this project, I explored data visualization techniques for exploratory data analysis using weather data from Tampa International Airport in 2022. The project recreates various plots such as histograms, density plots, and ridge plots to analyze temperature distributions. Additionally, it includes visualizations of text data from a dataset of FL Poly News Articles, using techniques like bigram frequency plots and word clouds. My favorite visualization for this project is shown below. It is a word cloud of words in a FL Poly News Article. Find the code and report in the `project_03/` folder.
